       " 'The Bugatti Mistral sends the iconic W16 engine off in style. With 1,577 horsepower and no roof, the Mistral takes the best bits of the Chiron and borrows elements from the Bolide and Divo to create a truly unique roadster. Of course, Bugatti plans to build just 99 examples of the Mistral at the cost of around $5.0 million in the US—and all of them are already accounted for.',\n",

       " 'Among Bugatti’s recently debuted vehicles, the Divo is a staff favorite. Though it shares much in common with its cheaper (!) sibling the Chiron, the Divo has a lot going for it to justify the extra money. By adding lighter wheels, a carbon fiber intercooler and removing some sound deadening, Bugatti made the Divo 77 pounds lighter than the Chiron. Though power is unchanged from the Chiron’s 1,500 ponies, The Divo features a different aerodynamic setup, which makes it 8 seconds quicker around the Nardo test track. Finally, the moment you’ve been waiting for: Bugatti is making 40 examples of the car, each costing $5.8 million.',\n",

The numerous fins, wings, and scoops help cool all the components and feed the thirsty engine, propelling it to an electronically limited 217-mph top speed. Pagani says the coupe costs $5.4 million and the Roadster is even more expensive at $6.0 million.',\n",

Under the hood is a twin-turbocharged 6.0-liter V-12 producing 829 horsepower and 809 pound-feet of torque, paired to a seven-speed sequential transmission for a real race-car–like feel.

Limited to just 10—dieci—units, the car is a modern throwback to the Bugatti EB110. At the same time, it’s meant to celebrate Bugatti’s momentous 110-year anniversary. Its unique styling cues won’t make everyone fall in love, but at least you won’t have to worry about seeing another one on the road.
